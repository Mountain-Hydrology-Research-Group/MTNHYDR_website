                        explores how snow accumulates and melts, how we measure it, and how we model it. The class project is one of 
                        the most valuable aspects, as it enables students to conduct a data analysis and/or modeling study to address

                        at UW and I appreciate that it showed me how to implement different data analysis methods, including fast Fourier

                        The course did a very good job of introducing students to tools (github, openmp, MPI, etc.), and really improved my 
                        productivity and the reproducibility of my research. It was taught by Randy LeVeque (http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/), 
                        and I think any of his courses could be good. One of his former students is a professor out here and I took his numerical 
                        methods class, which also ended up teaching me a lot about computer productivity tools. It seems computer science best 
                        practices are really important to that group.

                    <li>
                        <b>CEE 599: The Art and Science of Hydrologic Modeling</b> (Nijssen) - The course deals with the development, 
                        implementation, and evaluation of numerical models that simulate the flow of water and energy at and near the 
                        land surface. The course involves a group modeling project, as well as a class period where you teach the class 
                        on various topics that include, model evaluation, model forcing data, parameterization, spatial heterogeneity, 
                        and uncertainty. The group modeling project involves using different modeling decisions/parameterization with 
                        SUMMA - the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives. The class closely aligned with my own research 
                        interests and was taught very well. For more information see: http://summa-modeling-course.readthedocs.io/en/develop/
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>CEE 599/SEFS 521: Advanced Remote Sensing and Earth Observation</b> (Butman) - This course covers the fundamentals 
                        of electromagnetic radiation, reflection and absorption, black body radiation, use of the Plank Function, satellite and 
                        sensor technology, map projections, integration of GIS data, and digital image analysis. It also has a lab where you work 
                        with the remote sensing data using ENVI software. While it was titled “Advanced Remote Sensing” I found it would a good 
                        course for those with no prior remote sensing experience. The course was taught well and included a class project. Of 
                        three remote sensing classes I’ve taken this was my favorite and I think I got the most out of it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ATMS 511: Formation of Snow and Ice Masses</b> (Warren) - Steve Warren is an international expert in cryosphere 
                        science, and in this class he covers the fundamental physics involved in the mass and energy budget of seasonal snowpacks, 
                        glaciers, and sea ice. I learned about how snow forms and snow crystals grow, how snowpack goes through metamorphosis, 
                        optical physics, and learned about a time in earth's history when it looked like a snowball from outer space.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ATMS/ESS/ENVIR/SMA 585: Climate Impacts on the Pacific Northwest</b> - This course explores the science and policy 
                        issues related to climate change in the Pacific Northwest, with attention to the impact of climate change on snowpack 
                        and seasonal streamflow.

                    <li>
                        <b>CEE 578: Water Systems Management and Operations</b> – This course provides a wide overview of current research in 
                        water systems, from flood inundation mapping, to municipal watershed management, to reservoir operation. Lots of excellent 
                        guest speakers, and interesting class discussions related to reading and writing assignments.
                    </li>

                        <b>ESS 426: Fluvial Geomorphology</b> – This course covers river forms and processes in the classroom and in the field.

                    <li>
                        <b>Atmospheric Dynamics Series</b> (including ATMS 505, 509, and 551 plus 502, in which all of the math of the 3 part sequence 
                        is applied to understand observed phenomena like cyclones) - For those interested in any sort of weather related problems 
                        the dynamics sequence is a must for a much deeper knowledge of atmospheric processes. ATMS 505 - Fluid Dynamics with 
                        Bretherton is also a great stand-alone fundamentals course if you are planning to pursue research involving storm/wind dynamics.

                    <li>
                        <b>ATMS 532: Intro to Radiation</b> - Useful course for energy balance modeling of snow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ATMS 534: Remote Sensing</b> (Ackerman) - Covers the physics of various remote sensing instruments (e.g., optical/visible 
                        sensors, microwave sensors, lidar, radar), describes methods for retrieving variables of interest from raw data, and provides 
                        practical experience through a class project. While the focus is on atmospheric remote sensing, it is still useful for anyone 
                        interested in remote sensing of the land surface, including snow. Requires Intro to Radiation (ATMS 532).

                    <li>
                        <b>HCDE 509: Scientific Article Writing</b> - I took this course over the summer and it forces you to start drafting a paper. 
                        I was able to complete most of my introduction, and methods in this course. You are active in peer review and learn about 
                        submission and how to cater to your target journal. It is required for pharmaceutics students, but there were several folks 
                        in physical sciences as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>SEFS 520: GIS</b> - This was a great course to get some GIS experience and create some figures for my future posters, 
                        and papers. It is very introductory (it is split with a 200 level forestry class), but for me it was a great way to get 
                        GIS experience and it was applicable to my research.

                <b>Atmospheric Dynamics Series</b> (including ATMS 505, 509, and 551 plus 502, in which all of the math of the 3 part sequence 
                is applied to understand observed phenomena like cyclones) - For those interested in any sort of weather related problems 
                the dynamics sequence is a must for a much deeper knowledge of atmospheric processes. ATMS 505 - Fluid Dynamics with 
                Bretherton is also a great stand-alone fundamentals course if you are planning to pursue research involving storm/wind dynamics.

                <b>ATMS 532: Intro to Radiation</b> - Useful course for energy balance modeling of snow.

            <li>
                <b>ATMS 534: Remote Sensing</b> (Ackerman) - Covers the physics of various remote sensing instruments (e.g., optical/visible 
                sensors, microwave sensors, lidar, radar), describes methods for retrieving variables of interest from raw data, and provides 
                practical experience through a class project. While the focus is on atmospheric remote sensing, it is still useful for anyone 
                interested in remote sensing of the land surface, including snow. Requires Intro to Radiation (ATMS 532).

                <b>HCDE 509: Scientific Article Writing</b> - I took this course over the summer and it forces you to start drafting a paper. 
                I was able to complete most of my introduction, and methods in this course. You are active in peer review and learn about 
                submission and how to cater to your target journal. It is required for pharmaceutics students, but there were several folks 
                in physical sciences as well.

                <b>SEFS 520: GIS</b> - This was a great course to get some GIS experience and create some figures for my future posters, 
                and papers. It is very introductory (it is split with a 200 level forestry class), but for me it was a great way to get 
                GIS experience and it was applicable to my research.
