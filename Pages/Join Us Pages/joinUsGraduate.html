                A Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering with an emphasis on mountain hydrology prepares students 
                for a career as a professor or researcher at a university, as a researcher or consultant with a private 
                or government agency (county, state, or national), or as a data scientist in industry.  Most jobs are 
                located in regions that depend on the mountain snowpack for their water supply. Aside from rare exceptions, 
                we encourage people interested in an M.S. but not Ph.D. to enroll in the coursework-only masters program and 
                take the snow hydrology class. (Please see the FAQs page about the coursework vs. thesis programs.)
            </br>
                The University of Washington is an ideal place to study snow and mountain hydrology because it has strong 
                programs in all of the relevant disciplines. In addition to our department of Civil and Environmental 
                Engineering, students take classes in Atmospheric Sciences, Earth and Space Sciences, Applied Mathematics, 
                and The School of Environmental and Forest Sciences.  Students can benefit from the eScience Institute to 
                learn advanced data science, and can earn a data science option on their degree.  Many students in our group 
                also participate in the UW Program on Climate Change and in the Future Rivers Program.

            <p>
                We typically accept one to two new graduate students each year into our research group. Admission is competitive 
                and dependent on funding. We encourage all students to apply for whatever fellowships they are eligible for.  
                We expect students to have high grades in an undergraduate program that emphasizes quantitative skills. Prior 
                research experience and computer programming skills are preferred. Some projects also require outdoor skills 
                sufficient to conduct field research in remote areas at high elevations. Current and former students have come 
                from a wide variety of backgrounds, majors, and geographic areas. Some have taken advantage of community college 
                math classes and summer programming workshops to obtain relevant skills before starting graduate classes.  
                We value diversity and encourage students to reach out if they have questions about their specific fit.  
            </br>
                If you are interested in applying, please contact Professor Jessica Lundquist. In your initial e-mail, please specify 
                your GPA, GRE scores (if you have them), and prior experience, as well as your specific interests.
