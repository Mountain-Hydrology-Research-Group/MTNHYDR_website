                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Spatially distributed snow depth and snow duration data were collected over two to four snow 
                    seasons during water years 2011-2014 in experimental forest plots within the Cedar River 
                    Municipal Watershed, 50 km east of Seattle, Washington, USA. These 40 m Ã— 40 m forest plots, 
                    situated on the Western Slope of the Cascade Range, include control 2nd growth coniferous 
                    forest, variable density thinned forests, forest gaps in which a 20 m diameter gap was cut in 
                    the middle of each plot, and old growth stands. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) 
                    data was acquired over the study locations to characterize the forest canopy, and 
                    meteorological forcing data were collected in both open and forested locations.
                </p>

                <p>Many snow observations, including manual snow courses and snow duration observations from ground 
                    temperature sensors and time-lapse cameras were co-located in order to compare observational 
                    strategies, as well as to fully characterize the spatial distribution of snow depth and snow 
                    duration. Taken together, this dataset provides unique model forcing and validation data for 
                    hydrological analyses in a maritime watershed with heterogeneous forest cover.
                </p>

                Cedar observational data are archived in the
                <a href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/33268">UW Research Works Archive</a>. The complete dataset 
                includes snow depth observations from manual snow courses, distributed snow duration observations 
                from ground temperature sensors and time-lapse cameras, meteorological data collected at two open 
                locations and three forested locations, and hemispherical photographs.

                <p>
                A subset of these data, the fiber optic cable temperature data, are also archived at the 
                <a href="https://hiscentral.cuahsi.org/pub_network.aspx?n=4569">CUAHSI Water Data Center</a>. 
                To access these data, go to <a href="https://data.cuahsi.org/">CUAHSI's web interface</a>, 
                navigate to the Cedar River 
                Watershed (east of Seattle, WA) and then set the date range to 2010-2015 and search for "University 
                of Washington" as the data service. <!--Alternatively, you can use CUAHSI's open source desktop GIS
