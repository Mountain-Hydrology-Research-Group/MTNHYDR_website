Summary: 
Daily estimates of average unimpaired streamflow into the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (in cubic-meters-per-second) for water years 1970 to 2015.  These were estimated from Hetch Hetchy stage (for storage) and powerhouse draft and dam release records by Bruce McGurk, an employee of Hetch Hetchy water and Power from 2006 until 2011. Daily estimates cover the 24 hour period prior to 8 am of the date written, considering local standard time.  Evaporation is not accounted for.  

Accuracy & Quality Control:
The data in this file are based on USGS and other manual and electronic readings.  Unrealistic daily variation, particularly during low-flow periods, was smoothed by referencing nearby unimpaired streamflow records.
