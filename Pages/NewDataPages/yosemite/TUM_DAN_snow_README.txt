##PI:  Jessica D. Lundquist (jdlund@uw.edu), University of Washington 
##Funding:  National Science Foundation, CBET-0729830, and NASA Grant-NNX15AB29G

Summary: 
Snow water equivalent (SWE) recorded daily by weighing snow pillows at TUM and DAN for water years 1980 to 2015.  Manual snow course measurements adjacent to the same locations for most months between January and May for 1970 to 2015.

Accuracy & Quality Control:
Note that for the snow courses, the exact date of the survey is given in all cases except for water years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, where they were assigned to the closest first of the month because exact dates could not be found.  Actual date of the survey may vary by up to a week.
