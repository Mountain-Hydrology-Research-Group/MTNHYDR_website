Summary: 
Best estimates of discharge at a half-hourly timestep at 6 sub-basins in the Tuolumne River Watershed in cubic-meters-per-second (cms).  Where multiple estimates of discharge were available, we chose the most reliable instrument and location.  The record was inspected by eye, and times with likely ice jams were replaced with NaN values.

Accuracy & Quality Control:
Details are provided for each site in their individual files.  The upstream Lyell Fork gage was used preferentially to the downstream gage, and the Bug Camp Dana Fork gage was used preferentially to the Dana Lodge gage.  At Budd Creek, the data varied between upstream and downstream as documented in that individual site's file.
