                <br>
                <img src="../src/NewsPhotos/NewsGrad.png" />
                <p> We're excited to add two new graduate students, Emma Boudreau and Clinton Alden, to the 
                    group next fall. Emma is from Massachusetts and just finished her B.S. in civil engineering
                    at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. During undergrad, Emma studied stream discharge in 
                    High Mountain Asia using remote sensing techniques and traveled to Northern Alaska to collect field data.
                    She's excited to use these experiences while studying the remote sensing of snow. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Clinton received his B.S. in atmospheric science from the 
                    University of Utah. In addition to teaching avalanche and snow courses, he has researched the 
                    atmospheric dynamics of Californian atmospheric rivers with the Center for Western Weather and
                    Water Extremes at UC San Diego.
                </p>
                <p>Welcome to the team! We're excited to see where graduate school takes you.</p>

                <img src="../src/NewsPhotos/Jan2023Reu.png" />
                <p>This summer, Professor Lundquist will be at the Friday Harbor Lab in the San Juan Islands researching 
                    the conditions that lead to marine fog. Now that the REU-Blinks Undergraduate 
                    Research Program application is closed, two dedicated undergraduates are being selected to help with the research. 
                    Over the course of the summer, they'll deploy and analyze data from timelapse cameras, air temperature sensors, 
                    and air humidity sensors. Stay tuned to see who will join us this summer to help with the marine fog research!
                    To learn more about the REU-Blinks Undergraduate Research Program, visit <a href="https://fhl.uw.edu/mentors-and-projects-2023/">the REU-Blinks program webpage</a>;
                     Professor Lundquist's research is labeled #7 on the linked webpage.

                <p>Last month, the 2022 volume of the Mountain Views Chronicle was published with the 
                    theme of “research in the extreme.” The Mountain Views Chronicle is an annual journal
                    that showcases the technical and artistic works of researchers focused on mountain 
                    topics. In addition to Professor Lundquist’s article “An Extreme Number of Sensors 
                    in One Spot,” the 2022 volume contains a variety of insight research, poetry, and 
                    art. This 2022 Mountain Views Chronicle can be accessed at <a href="../src/PDFs/2022 Issue_Mt Views Chronicle.pdf"> this link</a>.
