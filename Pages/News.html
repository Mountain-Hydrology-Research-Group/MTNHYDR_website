                <p>Eli and Danny just arrived at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) in Crested 
                    Butte, Colorado. For the next few months, they will be collecting data on how snow sublimation impacts
                     snowpack and water availability. <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/mtnhydr/Pages/Research%20Profiles/SublimationOfSnow.html"> Click here</a> for more information on the project.

                <h1>December 2022: Professor Lundquist is Featured in the 2022 Mountain Views Chronicle</h1>
                <p>Last month, the 2022 volume of the Mountain Views Chronicle was published with the 
                    theme of “research in the extreme.” The Mountain Views Chronicle is an annual journal
                    that showcases the technical and artistic works of researchers focused on mountain 
                    topics. In addition to Professor Lundquist’s article “An Extreme Number of Sensors 
                    in One Spot,” the 2022 volume contains a variety of insight research, poetry, and 
                    art. This 2022 Mountain Views Chronicle can be accessed at <a href="../src/PDFs/2022 Issue_Mt Views Chronicle.pdf"> this link</a>.
