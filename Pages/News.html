                <p>   
                   Congratulations to Danny Hogan for successfully passing his master's defense. His research focuses on 
                   how snow sublimation influences snow mass balance, snow energy balance, and thus the accuracy of
                   water forecasting within the Colorado River Basin. Over the past winter, Danny delved into these questions by collecting snow data at 
                   the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) outside Crested Butte, Colorado. To learn more about 
                   Danny's work, please visit the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/mtnhydr/Pages/Research%20Profiles/SublimationOfSnow.html">Sublimation of Snow (SOS) project page</a>

                    analyzed how geostationary satellites with high temporal resolution can be used to determine snow surface temperatures.
                    The Mountain Hydrology Research Group is proud of Steven's dedication, and we're excited to see
                    what he does next! To learn more about Steven's work, check out the recording of

                <img src="../src/NewsPhotos/NewsGrad.png" />
                <p> We're excited to add two new graduate students, Emma Boudreau and Clinton Alden, to the 
                    group next fall. Emma is from Massachusetts and just finished her B.S. in civil engineering
                    at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. During undergrad, Emma studied stream discharge in 
                    High Mountain Asia using remote sensing techniques and traveled to Northern Alaska to collect field data.
                    She's excited to use these experiences while studying the remote sensing of snow. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Clinton received his B.S. in atmospheric science from the 
                    University of Utah. In addition to teaching avalanche and snow courses, he has researched the 
                    atmospheric dynamics of Californian atmospheric rivers with the Center for Western Weather and
                    Water Extremes at UC San Diego.
                </p>
                <p>Welcome to the team! We're excited to see where graduate school takes you.</p>
