                        around San Juan Island. By combining time-lapse camera data, temperature and humidity

                        interact to influence fog frequency and duration. Her findings aim to explain the

                <p> Congratulations to Steven Pestana for successfully defending his PhD dissertation! Steven's research
                    analyzed how geostationary satellites with high temporal resolution can be used to determine snow surface temperatures.
                    The Mountain Hydrology Research Group is proud of Steven's dedication, and we're excited to see
                    what he does next! To learn more about Steven's work, check out the recording of

                <img src="../src/NewsPhotos/NewsGrad.png" />
                <p> We're excited to add two new graduate students, Emma Boudreau and Clinton Alden, to the 
                    group next fall. Emma is from Massachusetts and just finished her B.S. in civil engineering
                    at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. During undergrad, Emma studied stream discharge in 
                    High Mountain Asia using remote sensing techniques and traveled to Northern Alaska to collect field data.
                    She's excited to use these experiences while studying the remote sensing of snow. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Clinton received his B.S. in atmospheric science from the 
                    University of Utah. In addition to teaching avalanche and snow courses, he has researched the 
                    atmospheric dynamics of Californian atmospheric rivers with the Center for Western Weather and
                    Water Extremes at UC San Diego.
                </p>
                <p>Welcome to the team! We're excited to see where graduate school takes you.</p>

                <p>This summer, Professor Lundquist will be at the Friday Harbor Lab in the San Juan Islands researching 
                    the conditions that lead to marine fog. Now that the REU-Blinks Undergraduate 
                    Research Program application is closed, two dedicated undergraduates are being selected to help with the research. 
                    Over the course of the summer, they'll deploy and analyze data from timelapse cameras, air temperature sensors, 
                    and air humidity sensors. Stay tuned to see who will join us this summer to help with the marine fog research!
