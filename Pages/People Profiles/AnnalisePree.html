                Annalise is a second-year undergraduate student studying Environmental Engineering. She grew up in Washington and loves 
                the snow and mountains. Since starting college during the pandemic, Annalise built out a school bus to live in for her 
                remote freshman year. She enjoyed figuring out how to wire solar electricity through YouTube and designing and building 
                the interior with the help of friends. In the winter she worked at Snoqualmie Pass teaching snowboarding and explored 
                other mountains in her free time. She never ever attended zoom class on a chairlift. Over the summer, Annalise worked 
                on the inaugural Lost Trails Found trail crew with Washington Trails Association where she spent time doing logout and 
                trail maintenance in the North Cascades. Her passion for snow, mountains, and the environment led her to be interested 
                in Mountain Hydrology research. She is excited to learn more about snow modelling and expand her coding skills. In her 
                free time, you can find Annalise climbing, snowboarding, surfing, backpacking, playing ice hockey, and baking Christmas 
                cookies.
