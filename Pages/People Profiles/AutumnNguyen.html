                Autumn grew up in the bustling city of Saigon, Vietnam, and she is now studying Computer Science 
                and Math at Mount Holyoke College. In the summer of 2023 she found herself on San Juan Island with 
                Professor Jessica Lundquist. Once dreamed of advocating for the environment by becoming an 
                activist, now she is advocating for it not through activism but through her computer science 
                skills. On San Juan Island, she researched coastal fog, specifically its frequency patterns and 
                effect on the intertidal ecosystem around the island. She wrote code to analyze satellite data and 
                used Machine Learning to classify fog photos from the field cameras. When on the island, Autumn 
                liked to take breaks (as frequent as every half an hour of coding) even when Jessica was working 
                non-stop next to her. During those breaks, she would exercise on the dock or get on a rowboat and 
                row around. She loves cross-cultural conversations, good vegan food, and sunrises. Oh, one more 
                thing: she loves the days with wispy fog (after the research)!
