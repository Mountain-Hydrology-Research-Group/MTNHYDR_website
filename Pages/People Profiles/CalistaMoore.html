                Calista was a undergraduate student at the University of Washington studying Civil & Environmental Engineering. Growing up in western Washington surrounded by 
                mountains and trees, she developed an appreciation for the environment at an early age. Calista gained an interest in hydrology during high school and 
                eventually would like to pursue her master's degree in Hydrology. She looks forward to spending the summer working on data analysis for snow modeling, 
                managing the lab, and updating the websites. Outside of school and research, Calista likes to hike, play tennis, and spend time with her friends and family.
