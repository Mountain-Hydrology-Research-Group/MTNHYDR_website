                Clinton was born and raised in San Diego, developing an interest in mountain hydrology through 
                summer backpacking trips in the Sierra Nevada. He graduated from the University of Utah with a 
                B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences. During his time in Utah, Clinton helped teach a snow and 
                avalanche dynamics course and worked part-time for the Center for Western Weather and Water 
                Extremes at UC San Diego. At CW3E, his research explored the atmospheric dynamics and cloud 
                properties of a high-impact atmospheric river in Northern California through remotely sensed 
                datasets. Clinton works with the Mountain Hydrology Group as a 
                graduate student working on detailed modeling of snowpack evolution and ice layer formation in 
                seasonal snow cover. When not lost in 10+ tabs of SNOTEL and model data, you can find him in 
                the mountains--backcountry skiing, trail running, or gravel biking!
