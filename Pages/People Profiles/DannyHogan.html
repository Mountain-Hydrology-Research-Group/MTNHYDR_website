                Danny grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and spent many summers and winters exploring the mountains of the Sierra Nevada and the California coast. He received a B.S. 
                in Environmental Engineering from Princeton University in 2019 where he also captained the men's lightweight rowing team. He is interested in investigating the impacts of 
                wildfire on forest-snow processes and the influences wildfires can have on snow model output. His interest in studying wildfire was piqued after he spent a summer in 
                college working for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in South Africa studying wildfires in Kruger National Park. After graduating, he spent two years
                working in the Bay Area as an environmental consultant field engineer. He performed numerous site investigations throughout California, primarily sampling groundwater,
                soil, and soil vapor. However, his passions for meteorology, hydrology (and mountains) lead him to joining the Mountain Hydrology Research Group. In his free time, Danny 
                can be found training for his next triathlon, cooking a new plant-based recipe, rowing on Lake Washington, backpacking in the PNW, or cuddling with his dog, Denali.
