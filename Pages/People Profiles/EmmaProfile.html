                Emma grew up in the South Shore of Massachusetts. She spent her summers either on the water pulling 
                her lobster traps, digging for clams, swimming in the North River, or hiking the White Mountains of 
                New Hampshire. She went to the University of Massachusetts-Amherst for undergrad where she received 
                a B.S. in Civil Engineering. In college, she joined a year-long research-based class where she 
                studied beaded streams and traveled to the North Slope of Alaska to collect in situ measurements. 
                She continued her research in Dr. Colin Gleasonâ€™s Fluvial Geomorphology Lab where she worked on a 
                project estimating discharge in the headwater streams of High Mountain Asia using remote sensing 
                and a Bayesian inference discharge algorithm. Her fascination with remote sensing capabilities and 
                love for mountains and rivers have led her to the Mountain Hydrology Research Group. She hopes to 
                improve snow modeling using remote sensing techniques to better understand water resources and 
                streamflow conditions in regions heavily dependent on snowmelt. In her free time, she likes to 
                hike, ski, listen to music while painting, or be on the water.
