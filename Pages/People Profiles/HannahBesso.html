                    Hannah grew up in Washington and received a B.S. in Environmental Science from Western Washington University. Since then, she has spent summers in Yosemite 
                    National Park as a Physical Science Technician, where she backpacked to alpine lakes to take water samples, conducted steambank stability surveys, and maintained 
                    stream gauges and snow towers in the Tuolumne River watershed. In the winters, she ski patrolled at Crystal Mountain and got to know the Cascade Mountain snowpack. 
                    She led a team for NASA DEVELOP, where she investigated rooftop solar power potential and used satellite data to measure greenness in cities across the U.S.. 
                    Her love for the mountains and desire to improve access to water resources drives her to study snow hydrology with the Mountain Hydrology Research Group. She 
                    is interested in improving snowpack modeling using remote sensing resources. In her free time, Hannah can be found trying new NYT recipes, skiing in the Cascades, 
                    climbing (in Yosemite when possible), and dreaming about getting a puppy while self-isolating at home.
