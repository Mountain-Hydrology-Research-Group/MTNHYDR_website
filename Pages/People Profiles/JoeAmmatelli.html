                <p>
                    Born and raised in Colorado, Joe spent the early years of his life growing a strong affection for mountain living and exploration.
                    Having completed a B.S. in Computer Engineering with a Minor in Mathematics at the University of Washington, Joe is now pursuing
                    a M.S. in Environmental Engineering so he can continue thinking about how technology and computation can help garner new insights
                    in the Earth sciences (and especially the mountainous regions that continue to capture his attention). Since joining the lab as an
                    undergraduate in summer 2019, Joe has assisted with field work, the design and deployment of hardware and software systems, and the 
                    analysis of hydroclimate data from Yosemite National Park. Joeâ€™s research, which he started while an undergraduate in the lab, 
                    investigates whether FFT-based video processing can be used to infer tree properties such as drought stress and snow interception. 
                    Whenever possible, Joe enjoys skiing and climbing with friends.
