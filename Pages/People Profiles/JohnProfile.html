                    John is a McCone Fellow in the Geography Department at UC Berkeley, 
                    where he studies climate dynamics. His current research focuses on 
                    large-scale climate energetics, with particular interests in the seasonal 
                    cycle of the Walker Circulation, its response to external forcings, and its 
                    role in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation through the Bjerknes feedback. 
                    While at UW, John was part of the Mountain Hydrology Group, managing the 
                    Zooniverse Snow Spotter Citizen Science program and exploring his lifelong 
                    fascination with snow and the mountains. He recently completed his 
                    undergraduate senior thesis and is in the process of submitting it for publication.
