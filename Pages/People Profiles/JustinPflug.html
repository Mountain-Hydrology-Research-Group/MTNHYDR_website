                Justin joined the Mountain Hydrology Research group as a graduate student in June 2016. Raised in Colorado, Justin graduated from Hastings College in Hastings, 
                Nebraska majoring in Physics as well as playing baseball for three years. Justin has always been passionate about the mountains and gained an interest in Hydrology 
                due to a research experience modeling subsurface aquifers at CU Boulder as well as work with precision agriculture systems at Hastings College. In his time at UW, 
                Justin has participated in the OLYMPEX and SnowEx projects. Justin's research has focused on snow model development and remote-sensing of repeatable snow patterns, 
                which he uses to infer distributed precipitation and snow depth in mountainous terrain for water management purposes. Outside of mountain hydrology, Justin also 
                enjoys all sports, backpacking, and adventures of all types. Justin encourages all prospective undergraduate, graduate, and professional students with an interest 
                in mountainous water resources to apply to the UW mountain hydrology research group. This includes individuals of all backgrounds, etnicities, gender identities, 
                and physical capabilities. Justin acknowledges that mountainous snow is a crucial water resource for a massive portion of the world, and that our progress in studying 
                mountainous snowpack can only benefit from a diverse, inclusive, and supportive research community. Justin encourages anyone interested in mountainous water research to 
                contact him, or any other member of the UW mountain hydrology research group.
