                Kehan Yang is a postdoctoral research scholar working with Dr. Nicoleta Cristea and Dr. Jessica Lundquist in the UW Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. 
                She earned her Ph.D. in Geography at University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Dr. Noah Molotch. Her Ph.D. research was focused on advancing our understanding of 
                spatiotemporal variability of seasonal snowpack and snow water equivalent using multi-platform remote sensing observations and statistical learning models. She received 
                a M.S. in the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences where her research was focused on monitoring spatiotemporal variability of alpine l
                akes on the Tibetan Plateau using multi-mission satellite data. She earned a B.S. in Engineering in the Department of Remote Sensing Science and Technology at Wuhan 
                University. Her current project focuses on developing a cloud-based cyberinfrastructure to derive high spatiotemporal resolution (i.e., ~ daily, ~3 m) snow cover information 
                from commercial Planet imagery with particular interest for the forest and meadow regions.
