                    Matthew grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin only a walking distance away from Lake Michigan, 
                    and he spent most of his youth swimming in “Mama Michigan” or sledding down lake bluffs. Ever since then, 
                    he’s had water on the brain. At the University of Washington, Matthew studies environmental engineering and 
                    is always exploring the interdisciplinary nature of water resources. Some of his favorite water-related topics 
                    include stream geomorphology, glaciology, the applicability of ancient water acquisition strategies for
                     mitigating modern water crises, and the link between water and community vibrance. Outside of school, 
                     Matthew has pursued his passion for enhancing community awareness of water resource issues by working as a 
                     RainWise contractor in the Seattle area. With the US Forest Service, he’s mapped landslides, monitored large woody debris installations, and 
                     investigated streambed geomorphology by reassessing aquatic organism passageway designs on streams recently disturbed by landslides.

                    Matthew graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering in 2024, after greatly contributing to the 
                    UW MTNHYDR team in his effort to curate the group's website with the goal of making the lab's work accessible to
                     as many audiences as possible. During graduation, he was distinguished as a recipient of the Dean's Medal for Academic 
                     Excellence. Each year, the UW Dean of Engineering recognizes two exceptional students who fulfill unequaled criteria in 
                     grades, rigor and distribution of courses, research experience, extracurricular activities, and leadership. We are beyond 
                     proud of Matthew, and look forward to seeing where the future takes him!

                    He'll be working towards his goals of helping urban ecosystems thrive at Osborn 
                    Consulting in Bellevue– gaining experience designing green stormwater infrastructure, measuring storm water 
                    contamination, and integrating community feedback into each project. When he’s not in school or working, 
                     Matthew is usually hammocking along Lake Washington, playing his banjo, backpacking in the Cascades, or 
                     on a quest to find the northernmost salal plant (which he estimates is in the vicinity of Sitka, Alaska).
