                    Pau is a visiting PhD student from the University of Lausanne Switzerland. In his research, he investigates how much snow information is in river discharge observation records, and how we can retrieve it to learn more about seasonal snow dynamics. The main methodology he employs is inverse hydrological modeling, which consists of first generating a large number of snow simulations, then feeding these into a runoff model to produce their corresponding streamflow output, and finally comparing the streamflow simulations against the streamflow observations to assess which snow simulations are most realistic. In his free time you'll find him birding, playing the piano or engaging in American cultural acitivities.
