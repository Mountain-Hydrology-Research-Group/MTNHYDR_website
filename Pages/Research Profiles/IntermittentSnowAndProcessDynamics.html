                By combining field observations with a multiple-hypotheses approach to model development, we seek a better understanding of the dominant processes 
                in the transient snow zone and a path towards a better, coupled atmosphere-hydro model.

                    We are teaming with Dr. Martyn Clark at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to develop modular snow models that allow for the evaluation 
                    of each modeling process or algorithm independently. By eliminating the possibility of compensating errors from the evaluation process this structure exposes 
                    the sources of model uncertainty. We will analyze the performance of boundary conditions supplied by both the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and 
                    field observations. A primary field sites at Snoqualmie Pass, WA has been used for testing and evaluation.

                    The intermittent, or transient, snow zone is defined as areas where 10-50% of October to March precipitation falls as snow. Because intermittent snow 
                    is almost always ripe to melt, it responds immediately to energy inputs, resulting in a change in snow water equivalent (SWE) rather than just a change in 
                    internal snowpack temperature. This readiness-to-melt makes intermittent snow an extra sensitive indicator of snow model performance. Therefore, any model 
                    improvements vetted in this area will translate into better snow modeling everywhere, including the seasonal snow zone.
