            <h2>The Problem: Inaccurate Streamflow Predictions</h2>
            <p>
                Snow provides over 60% of water supplies in the Western United States, and in general, spring snow 
                measurements provide a good prediction of summer streamflow.  However, 
                in some years, these streamflow predictions are not accurate, and water managers struggle to 
                efficiently allocate water resources.  In many studies, warming temperatures 
                correspond to less observed streamflow per unit precipitation input.  However, key elements, 
                including basin heterogeneity, gauge undercatch, groundwater flow, and water 
                storage, are often not represented in models or predictions, and physical hydrologic models 
                diverge widely in their hydrologic sensitivity to warming. We will combine 
                distributed observations and modeling to test the following hypotheses.</p>

			<ol type="1">
				<li>Fall rainstorms recharge soil moisture and groundwater, increasing subsurface connectivity 
                    and the efficiency of winter snowpack to generate streamflow.</li><br>

				<li>More uniformly-distributed snow cover leads to greater subsurface water connectivity and 
                    more efficient water delivery to the stream. More variable snow cover, either through a 
                    greater elevational gradient or increased patchiness, leads to less effective recharge and 
                    greater evaporative losses. Only modeling that represents subsurface water transfer from 
                    snow-covered to snow-free grid cells will represent these effects.</li><br>

                <li>Warming temperatures and increased rain relative to snow over recent decades have changed 
                    snow distributions in ways that decrease runoff efficiency, increasing the frequency of 
                    snow free areas at lower elevations fed by snow at higher elevations, which increases basin 
                    total evapotranspiration.</li>
			</ol>
            <h2>Our Study</h2>
            <p>
                Our questions require both long timeseries and detailed, distributed observations.  We propose to 
                first investigate our hypotheses over the well-instrumented East River (Colorado) and Tuolumne 
                River (California) basins. These long-term observations are augmented with detailed distributed 
                surface flux observations obtained during the 2021-23 multi-agency atmospheric campaigns of SAIL, 
                SPLASH, and SOS in the East River basin.  We will use models to establish essential process 
                representations and to directly test hypotheses. We will then test for the essential minimum 
                observations and process representations to expand to larger scales.

				Our study will directly inform modelers and water managers of the key processes that must be 
                represented to accurately predict runoff originating from seasonal snow in mountain watersheds, 
                leading to improved understanding, prediction, and planning at seasonal and longer timescales.
