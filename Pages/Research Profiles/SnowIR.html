                As seasonal snow that falls in the mountains melts, it becomes a critical source of water for 
                humans and the natural environment humans depend on. Our ability to predict when snow will melt, 
                how much  will melt, and how those melt patterns are changing could be improved with better remote 
                sensing observations such as satellite measurements. By taking infrared (IR) images of snow-covered 
                areas, we can map snow surface temperatures for large regions. However, all remote sensing 
                observations have tradeoffs between spatial resolution (spatial resolution is the size of the land 
                surface captured within an individual image pixel ) and temporal resolution (temporal resolution is 
                the time between repeat observations). In this project we are working towards developing improved 
                snow-surface temperature maps derived from IR remote sensing observations by:

				<ol type="1">
					<li>Understanding how these tradeoffs (e.g. spatial vs. temporal resolution) and other 
                        properties of remote sensing (such as the electromagnetic wavelengths of observations and 
                        the geometry with which those electromagnetic waves hit the earth) impact the utility of 
                        different remote sensing sources </li>
					<li>Testing methods (e.g. spectral mixture analysis, sensor fusion, downscaling) of retrieving 
                        finer spatial and temporal resolution snow-surface temperature information by combining 
                        multiple remote sensing observations

            <h2>Challenges Facing IR Observation of Surface Snow Temperatures</h2>
            <p>
                Maps of snow-surface temperature at the finest spatial resolutions (cm-scale) can reveal in detail 
                the interactions between forests and snowpack that involve sunlight, shading, warming of snow by 
                trees, forest litter, and <a href="https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Albedo">albedo</a>. 
                To create these maps, small thermal IR cameras have been mounted 
                on drones flown over small-scale study areas that are much smaller than one square kilometer in 
                size. To cover larger areas much greater than one square kilometer, we have also used thermal IR 
                cameras mounted on an aircraft which can provide meter-scale spatial resolution images. 
            </p>
			<p>
				The accuracy of surface temperature maps produced by these airborne IR systems are impacted by their
                spatial resolution and <a href="https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/en/8719-angle-conversion#:~:text=The%20viewing%20angle%20is%20the,the%20pitch%20and%20roll%20angles.">view angles</a>. 
                In forested mountain watersheds, some pixels will overlap with 
                both snow and trees, recording a temperature signal that is a mixture of the cold snow and warmer 
                trees. The low cost, uncooled, broadband IR cameras used for airborne surface temperature mapping 
                are also subject to other sources of error, and biases which uniformly shift the recorded 
                temperatures up or down. Sensor nonuniformity and vignetting (see figure S1a of 
                <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2019WR025699&file=wrcr24335-sup-0001-Figure_SI-S01.pdf">this paper</a> 
                for an example of sensor nonuniformity) can cause errors in the reported temperature that vary across the 
                IR image, even  when observing a uniform temperature surface such as a melting snow surface. 
                Temperature changes to the camera itself from the ambient air, direct sunlight, or self-heating 
                from the electronics can also introduce biases to these airborne IR images.

				In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025699">Pestana et al. (2019)</a> we used coincident 
                observations of snow, water, and tree canopy temperatures taken in Sagehen Creek, California USA, 
                and Davos, Switzerland to assess how all of these factors influenced very fine spatial resolution 
                (cm-scale) IR imagery from a drone and meter-scale resolution IR imagery from an aircraft. The known
                temperature of melting snow was used to calibrate the IR imagery to correct for the rapidly 
                changing temperature biases of the cameras. Additionally, the observed temperatures of mixed 
                pixels were found to depend not only on the spatial resolution of the measurement but also on the 
                forest density, distribution, and the view angle of observations.

            <h2>Satellite IR Observations</h2>
            <p>
                In satellite imagery with spatial resolutions of about 1 km, any IR pixel in a snowy, forested 
                mountain scene will be a mix of snow and trees. <a href="./snowTemperatureSierra.html">A spectral 
                unmixing method</a> that can resolve the snow-surface and forest canopy temperatures that contribute
                to a mixed-pixel temperature reading was demonstrated in 
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.03.001">Lundquist et al. (2018)</a> for a study area 
                in the upper Tuolumne River Basin in the Sierra Nevada of California. Multispectral imagery from 
                the IR bands of MODIS (<a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/">the Moderate Resolution 
                Imaging Spectroradiometer</a> onboard NASA’s Terra and 
                Aqua satellites) were used to retrieve separate snow and forest temperatures for each mixed-pixel. 
                The accuracy of these computed temperatures were then evaluated against ground-based and 
                meter-scale airborne IR observations.

                The MODIS instruments on NASA Terra and Aqua satellites together provide four observations 
                per day for mid-latitude mountain ranges. For distributed models that try to predict snowmelt 
                hourly, finer temporal resolution (more frequent) satellite observations would be needed to 
                evaluate or <a href="https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Data_assimilation">assimilate into those 
                models</a>. Geostationary weather satellite imagery, such as from NOAA’s Geostationary Operational 
                Environmental Satellite (GOES) Advanced Baseline Imagers (ABI), take images at 5 minute intervals 
                with similar multispectral bands as MODIS. Ongoing work is evaluating:

				<ol type="1">

                        imagers such as MODIS and ASTER?

					<li>Can separate snow and forest temperatures be retrieved from GOES ABI multispectral imagery 
                        at sub-hourly temporal resolutions?
