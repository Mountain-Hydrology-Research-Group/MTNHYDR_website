            <h2><strong>Background and Motivation</strong></h2>
                <p>Winter snowpack in the mountains of a river basin is often used to inform how much water is expected to be 
                    available throughout the year. However, there has been an unexpected mismatch between the winter snowpack 
                    totals in the headwaters of the Colorado and resultant discharge coming down the Colorado River in recent 
                    years. For example, in both 2020 and 2021, snowpack totals within the upper Colorado basin were at or above 
                    normal, but streamflows within the basin were around 30 to 50% of there historic normal values. Where did 
                    the water go?</p>
            <h2><strong>Sending an SOS Call</strong></h2>
                <p>To help address this question, we are directing our focus into studying the role that snow sublimation &ndash; 
                    the phase transition from soild ice crystals to water vapor &ndash; plays in the water balance in the mountains. 
                    Snow sublimation has been measured or modeled to remove anywhere from 10% to 90% of snow from a snowpacks, 
                    depending on the location and scale of measurement. Due to difficulty involved in measuring and parameterizing 
                    sublimation in the mountains, it is one of the major uncertainties within hydrologic models. Supported by 
                    funding from the National Science Foundation, the Sublimation of Snow (SOS) campaign will use a wide array of 
                    instruments deployed in the East River basin near Crested Butte, Colorado for winter 2023. With a wide-ranging 
                    set measurements at multiple levels above the snow surface we hope to address a few different questions specific
                    to sublimation:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li value="1"><b>What governs characteristics of the near-surface boundary layer over snow in complex terrain?</b></li>
                </ol>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We will link turbulence measured at multiple heights above the surface to valley-scale wind fields, changing 
                        snow surfaces, and blowing snow.</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li value="2"><b>How much snow sublimation occurs during different boundary layer regimes, and how does this affect 
                        the total seasonal mass and energy balance?</b></li>
                </ol>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We will maintain multiple measurements through the winter by having a team of two students live near the site 
                        and record regular observations of the snowpack and weather conditions</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li value="3"><b>What measurement and analysis strategies are most robust for quantifying snow sublimation in a
                        mountain valley?</b></li>
                </ol>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>To address this question, we will compare eddy covariance with mass and energy balance observations. </li>
                </ul>
            <h2><strong>Alliances of Acronyms</strong></h2>
            <p>The site of our field deployment, hosted at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory 
                (<a href="https://www.rmbl.org/" style="RoyalBlue" target="_blank">RMBL</a>) allows for unprecedented collaboration between different 
                organizations and projects focused on studying water from the sub-surface to the atmosphere within the East River 
                watershed. These projects include the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory 
                (<a href="https://sail.lbl.gov/about/" style="RoyalBlue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAIL</a>) supported by the U.S. Department of 
                Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility and the Study of Precipitation, the Lower Atmosphere
                and Surface for Hydrometeorology (<a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/splash/" style="RoyalBlue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPLASH</a>) operated by NOAA.
                The National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Earth Observations Laboratory (EOL), working directly with our campaign, is 
                responsible for the deployment of their Integrated Surface Flux System 
                (<a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/observing_facilities/isfs" style="RoyalBlue" target="_blank">ISFS</a>) to measure near-ground atmospheric turbulence,
                energy exchanges, and snow mass. More information on their role can be found
                <a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/sos" style="RoyalBlue" target="_blank">here</a>. We are also fortunate to be working with the Aspen 
                Global Change Institute (<a href="https://www.agci.org/projects/sublimation-of-snow-sos-project" style="RoyalBlue" target="_blank">AGCI</a>) who is 
                responsible for much of the outreach and documentation of our project and will help us ensure our science is available and approachable 
                for a wide array of audiences.&nbsp;</p>
