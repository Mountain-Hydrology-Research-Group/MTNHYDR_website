            <h2><strong>Background and Motivation</strong></h2>
                <p>Winter snowpack in the mountains of a river basin is often used to inform how much water is 
                    expected to be available throughout the year. However, in recent years, there has been an unexpected mismatch 
                    between the winter snowpack totals in the headwaters of the Colorado River and the resultant 
                    discharge coming down the river. For example, in both 2020 and 2021, snowpack 
                    totals within the upper Colorado basin were at or above normal, but streamflows within the basin 
                    were around 30 to 50% of their historic normal values. Where did the water go?
                </p>
            <h2><strong>Sending an SOS Call</strong></h2>
                <p>To help address this question, we are directing our focus into studying the role that snow 
                    sublimation &ndash; the phase transition from solid ice crystals to water vapor &ndash; plays 
                    in the disappearance of mountain snow. Snow sublimation has been measured or modeled to remove 
                    anywhere from 10% to 90% of the snow from a snowpack, depending on the location and scale of 
                    measurement. For example, ridgelines that experience heavy winds can lose a lot of snow to 
                    sublimation while snow protected by trees will experience less sublimation-driven snow loss. 
                    Due to the difficulty involved in measuring and modeling sublimation in the mountains, it is 
                    one of the major uncertainties within hydrologic models. Supported by funding from the National
                    Science Foundation, the Sublimation of Snow (SOS) campaign will measure sublimation using a 
                    wide array of instruments deployed in the East River Basin near Crested Butte, Colorado during 
                    the of winter 2023. Some of these instruments will record observations related to atmospheric 
                    conditions (such as wind, humidity, and temperature) in the layer of air just above the snow, 
                    which is called the near-surface boundary layer. Other instruments will continuously record 
                    how much water is in the snowpack (termed snow water equivalent), track snow depth over time, 
                    and observe how snow moves during high wind events.. Instruments will also record the snow’s 
                    energy balance, which is a measure of how energy from the sun or atmosphere is entering and 
                    leaving the snow. With a wide-ranging set measurements at multiple levels above the snow 
                    surface, we hope to address a few different questions specific to sublimation:

                    <li>We will link turbulence measured at multiple heights above the surface to valley-scale wind
                        fields, changing snow surfaces, and blowing snow.</li>

                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We will maintain multiple measurements through the winter by having a team of two students
                        live near the site. There, they will record regular observations of the snowpack, observe 
                        weather conditions, and deploy additional instruments at the site.</li>

                    <li>To address this question, we will compare our estimates of sublimation using multiple
                        methods.

                (<a href="https://www.rmbl.org/" class="blueLink" target="_blank">RMBL</a>), allows for 
                unprecedented collaboration between different organizations and projects focused on studying ground,
                surface, and atmospheric water within the East River watershed. One of these projects is the 
                Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory 
                (<a href="https://sail.lbl.gov/about/" class="blueLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAIL</a>), which is 
                supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility.

                (<a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/splash/" class="blueLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPLASH</a>),
                a project operated by NOAA, is also based at RMBL. The National Center for Atmospheric Research's 
                (NCAR) Earth Observations Laboratory (EOL), working directly with our campaign, is responsible for 
                the deployment of their Integrated Surface Flux System 
                (<a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/observing_facilities/isfs" class="blueLink" target="_blank">ISFS</a>) 
                to measure near-ground atmospheric turbulence, energy exchanges, and snow mass. More information on
                their role can be found 
                <a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/sos" class="blueLink" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                We are also fortunate to be working with the Aspen Global Change Institute 
                (<a href="https://www.agci.org/projects/sublimation-of-snow-sos-project" class="blueLink" target="_blank">AGCI</a>), 
                who is responsible for much of the outreach and documentation of our project. They are also helping
                us ensure that our science is available and approachable for a wide array of audiences.
