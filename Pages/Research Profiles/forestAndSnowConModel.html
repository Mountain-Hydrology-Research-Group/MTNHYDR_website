            <h1>Forests and Snow Storage in the PNW</h1>
            <h2>Conceptual Model </h2>
            <p>
            Based on observations of the magnitude and duration of snow storage at paired open and forested sites in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, we found that the difference in snow disappearance 
            timing ranges from synchronous to snow lasting up to 13 weeks longer in the open at 12 out of 14 sites.  The exception was observed at sites exposed to high wind speeds, where snow lasts 
            up to 5 weeks longer in the forest than in the open.  In a paper currently under review at Hydrological Processes, we present extensive analysis of these data and attribute the differences 
            in snow disappearance timing primarily to the forest effects on snow accumulation rather than ablation. 
            </p>

            <p>
            From these analyses, we have developed a decision tree framework for stepping through the key controlling factors that determine how forests modify snow processes.  You can access 
            <a href="https://nccwsc.usgs.gov/webinar/ForestsandSnow" target="_blank">the webinar describing the framework here.</a> Note that we are currently preparing a publication to describe the 
            model and supporting data in detail.
            </p>

            <p>
            The beta-version decision tree starts with wind as the first driver, then considers magnitude of interception (as a function of winter temperature), and the importance of forest effects 
            on shading.  We are in the process of refining this model; please note that this is a beta version:

            <h3>Mean Winter Temperature</h3>
            <p>
                Previous work has demonstrated that canopy snow interception efficiency and storage capacity are larger where and when temperature is higher.  Thus, we use winter temperature as a tool to 
                estimate the relative magnitude of snow storage difference between forest and open due to canopy interception and subsequent loss (mostly melt). The map shows mean December-January-February 
                temperature from 800 m gridded climate normals over the period 1981-2010.

            <h3> Cloudiness </h3>
            <p> 
                To characterize average spring cloudiness, we used daily 1/16° gridded historical data developed by Livneh et al., [2013], and utilized daily maximum and minimum air temperature from 
                1981-2010 to compute an atmospheric transmittance coefficient based on the diurnal temperature range, following the equation developed by Bristow and Campbell [1984].  Since the transmission 
                of solar radiation through the atmosphere is a function of water vapor, we utilize the coefficient from this empirical model, which was developed and tested in the Pacific Northwest, as a 
                proxy for cloud cover. High atmospheric trasmittance values indicate clear sky conditions (red), and low values indicate cloudy conditions (blue). We aggregated the daily values to monthly 
                mean values, and then computed the seasonal means for different combinations of months.

            <h3>Potential Annual Solar Radiation</h3>
            <p> 
                Topographic position, including latitude, aspect, and slope, determines the potential total incoming solar radiation incident on a location, neglecting the shading influence of surrounding 
                topography and vegetation.  Thus, the highest annual potential solar radiation are on steep, south-facing slopes, whereas the lowest values are on north-facing slopes.  This relationship is 
                clearly illustrated in the gridded potential solar radiation over the Cascade volcanoes, where high values correspond with the south side of Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, and others. This map 
                is based on the 800 m digital elevation model from PRISM, and the equation developed by McCune and Keon [2002]. Depending on the scale of interest, a slope-aspect analysis of higher resolution 
                elevation data may be more appropriate for assessing topographic position.
