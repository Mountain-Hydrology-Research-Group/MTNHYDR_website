        <h2>Background: How Does the Forest Affect Snow Storage in the PNW?</h2>
        <p>
        <i>By utilizing <a href="/mtnhydr/research/citsci.shtml" target="_blank">field observations collected by volunteer citizen scientists and students in central Idaho</a> and a network 
            of collaborating snow study sites, we are assessing forest effects on snow storage across the Pacific Northwest.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            Trees intercept snow, which leads to less snow accumulation in forests (this is one of the reasons 
            for tree wells, which backcountry skiers know well). Once the snow is on the ground, trees also provide 
            shading from the sun and the wind (which reduces melt), but the trees are also warmer than the sky, 
            which can increase melt (this is another reason for tree wells). Thus, the net effect of the forest on 
            snowpack duration varies with climate, topography, and forest density.
        </p> 

        <h3> Predicting Snow Duration </h3>
        <p>  
        <strong><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wrcr.20504/abstract" target="_blank">Previous 
        investigations</a> of snow duration in forests</strong> indicate that average winter temperature is a key 
        predictor of whether the presence of forest cover will accelerate or delay snow disappearance. However, 
        local effects such as topographic position (e.g., north-facing vs. south-facing slopes), weather patterns 
        (e.g., high winds), and forest characteristics (e.g., canopy density) also have an important influence on 
        how the presence of or type of forest affects snow duration.

        <p>
        The <a href="http://www.doi.gov/csc/northwest/index.cfm" target="_blank">Northwest Climate Science Center</a>
         is supporting our work to develop a conceptual model for considering all of these local-scale influences in 
         order to help guide forest management decisions now and under different climate warming scenarios. 
         Understanding and predicting the effect of forest cover (and density) on snow duration is critical for land 
         and water management decisions such as where to thin forests to minimize fire risk, where to suppress fires, 
         and how to respond to insect outbreaks.
        </p>

        <p>
        To test and refine this model, we need observations of where snow lasts longer in the forest versus the open 
        from many sites in different regions that capture a range of climates and terrain types (together, having such 
        a variety of observations is referred to as “spatially-distributed”). We have snow data 
        from several field sites around the region thanks to collaborators at 
        <a href="http://www.geo.oregonstate.edu/~nolina/RESEARCH_GROUP/" target="_blank"> Oregon State University</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/frfs/timothylink" target="_blank"> University of Idaho</a>, and 
        <a href="http://jamesalutz.com/" target="_blank"> Utah State University</a>. 
        However, we needed  observations in more locations, so we ran a 4-year campaign to utilize 
        <a href="citsci.shtml">citizen scientists</a>.
