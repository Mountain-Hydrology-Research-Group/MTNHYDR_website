        <h2>Measuring Snow Interception with FFT-Based Video Processing</h2>
        
        <p>
            Snow intercepted by forest canopies dictates, among other properties, 
            how much snow accumulates on the surface below the canopy. Given that
            nearly half of the snow covered zone in the Northern Hemisphere is forested 
            and up to two thirds of falling snow is intercepted by the canopy, understanding 
            the magnitude and timing of interception events is important for accurately 
            quantifying snow accumulation over the course of a season. Despite its importance 
            to hydrologic modeling, measuring canopy snow interception is challenging. As a result, 
            most models depend upon previous interception parameterizations representative of 
            specific regions and climates, leading to a significant amount of uncertainty in
            model output.

            Building upon a growing body of work relating the sway frequency of a tree to other
            physical properties, we are evaluating whether FFT-based video processing of tree sway 
            can be used to infer changes in tree mass due to snow interception. Existing studies have
            demonstrated the potential of using accelerometers to measure tree sway frequency and 
            quantify various tree properties (including snow interception). However, accelerometers 
            only provide point measurements of frequency and can be cumbersome to install, which limits 
            the spatial and temporal resolution over which measurements can be collected. Video cameras 
            represent an inexpensive alternative that most notably improve the spatial resolution of 
            frequency measurements. Hence, we propose spectral analysis of pixel brightness time series
            can be used to map sway frequency across a domain an measure snow interception. In particular, 
            we are:
            <ol>
                <li>Investigating the degree to which tree sway frequency measurements 
                    obtained from fft-based video processing agree with accelerometer measurements 
                    of the same region
                </li>
                <li> Assessing what factors (e.g. resolution, angle, meteorologic conditions) are 
                    important to consider when extending video processing techniques to trees
                </li>    
                <li> 
                    Concluding as to whether video processing offers a robust alternative to 
                    accelerometers for measuring tree sway frequency across time and space
                </li>
            </ol>
