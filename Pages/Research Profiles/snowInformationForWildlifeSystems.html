            Seasonal changes in snowpack have a profound influence on the energetics and population dynamics (e.g. 
            the energy expenditure, foraging patterns, predator-prey interactions, hibernation, etc) of wildlife 
            that reside in snow covered regions. That said, substantial uncertainty remains in understanding the 
            key processes that drive the life cycle of snow in regions with sparse meteorological stations and 
            complex terrain. This uncertainty greatly impedes our understanding of how snowpack characteristics 
            impact wildlife populations, which makes it difficult to predict how climate change may impact wildlife 
            as it alters snowpacks. The overarching goal of our study is to address the coupled questions: what are 
            the key factors driving snow accumulation and disappearance during shoulder seasons, and which snow 
            properties are most important for wildlife applications? To address this question, we are partnering 
            with wildlife biologist Laura Prugh from the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences at the 
            University of Washington and with snow assimilation specialist Mike Durand from Ohio State University 
            to determine how we can best use snow measurements from space to predict snow factors important to 
            wildlife.
