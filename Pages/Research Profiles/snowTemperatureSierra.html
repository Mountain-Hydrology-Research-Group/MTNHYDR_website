                    Snow in complex terrain is highly variable, so distributed modeling is essential for proper representations of snow and streamflow. However, 
                    distributed model development has been hampered by a lack of spatial measurements. Remote-sensing (using both space-borne and air-borne instruments) 
                    provides critical spatial measurements, but to definitively identify the “best” model configuration, multiple measurements are needed at different times \
                    of year and at different spatial scales (see figure above).

                We are teaming with NASA JPL's Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) and with Dr. Chris Chickadel at the UW Applied Physics Lab (APL) to determine the best way to 
                integrate distributed snow depth and snow surface temperature measurements into distributed snow modeling. ASO snow depth measurements are available approximately 
                monthly since 2013, and we flew our first infrared measurements in February 2016 (see movie above). We are working on using these high resolution measurements to 
                better utilize coarser-scale measurements from satellites, such as MODIS.
