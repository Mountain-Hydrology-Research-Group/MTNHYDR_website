            <h2>Research Background</h2>
            <p>
                Snow in complex terrain is highly variable, so 
                <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/distributed-hydrology-soil-vegetation-model">distributed 
                modeling</a> is essential to properly represent snow and snowmelt streamflow. However, distributed 
                model development has been hampered by a lack of spatial measurements (i.e., measurements from a 
                variety of locations). Remote-sensing (using both space-borne and air-borne instruments) provides 
                critical spatial measurements of snow depth and temperature, but to identify the “best” model 
                configuration, multiple measurements are needed at different times of year and at different spatial 
                (i.e., geographic) scales (see figure below).

            <h2>Research Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Our work focuses on determining the best way to integrate distributed snow depth and snow surface 
                temperature measurements into distributed snow modeling. To achieve this aim, we are teaming with 
                <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/airborne-snow-observatory-aso">the Airborne Snow 
                Observatory (ASO)</a> at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and with Dr. Chris Chickadel at 
                the <a href="https://www.apl.washington.edu/">UW Applied Physics Lab (APL)</a>. ASO snow depth 
                measurements are available approximately monthly since 2013, and we flew our first infrared 
                measurements in February 2016 (see movie below). We are working on using these high resolution 
                measurements that are accurate down to one meter scales to better utilize larger-scale measurements 
                from satellite imagers such as the <a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/">Moderate Resolution 
                Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)</a>.
