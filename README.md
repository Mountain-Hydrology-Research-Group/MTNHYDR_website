### Site Structure
The site is organized into several different folders:
- CSS folder holds all CSS files. 
  - All pages use the general index.css file for basic universal styles, including the header and footer.
  - For style code specific to the index.html page, see indexContent.css
- The JS folder holds all JavaScript files:
  - There is one index.js file that holds all of the in site code.
  - The second file is a jQuery file that holds all of the code that allows for jQuery to run. This is not necessarily needed as it can be linked as a url in the browser., however just to make things easier it is used.
- Pages holds all html files other than the index.html file.
  - There are subfolders in here just to keep things organized. Notably, the subsections hold profiles for people and research.
- the src folder holds all media that is used in the site.
